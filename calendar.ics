DESCRIPTION:"The ABCs of Ageplay"\nPresented by Miss Erin and William\n\n\n
 About the Workshop:\n\nEver been propositioned by a "Little?"  Curious what
  all this silliness is about and how folks could get off on it?  Got any se
 cret desires to try more than pigtails and sucking on lollipops?  Looking f
 or a way to start a conversation about ageplay?  Whether you are squicked o
 ut by the thought or you have been proudly proclaiming your proclivities fo
 r years\, we hope you'll join us for some silly\, sexy fun.\n\nMiss Erin an
 d William will cover many topics including examples of ageplay scenes and r
 elationships\, ways to integrate ageplay with BDSM and every-day life\, tip
 s for keeping a "Big" happy and a Little in line\, negotiating points for a
  scene with an ageplayer\, and the subtle (and not so subtle) ways Power Ex
 change plays out during ageplay.  There will also be demonstrations and cos
 tume changes throughout the presentation\, both to provide illustrations an
 d to make sure most folks giggle.  They call it"play" for a reason\, so com
 e prepared to take fun seriously.\n\nPrice TBD\n\nThis class is open to all
  RKS members and approved guests. \n\nFollowed by our regularly scheduled p
 lay party  from 8 p.m. til 2 a.m.!\n\nQuestions?  Please email us at rks@ro
 chesterkinksociety.com\n\n***\n\nMiss Erin considers herself new to kink\, 
 but her dedication to debauchery and mad research skills enable her to spea
 k with such certainty and authority that you just might forget that.  She b
 rings a Scientific approach to her discussions as well as her play\, and sh
 e delivers her analysis with a trademark Southern charm and wit.  She consi
 ders herself a\nhedonist and has experienced life on both sides of the leas
 h\, but her role as Mommy to a naughty little boy for the last three years 
 will be most applicable on this night.  She has attended Littles munches an
 d ageplay nights in Boston and Rochester and given many presentations in he
 r career\, but this will be her first one with a kinky topic and wardrobe c
 hanges.\n\nWilliam is a veteran ageplayer with more than 25 years of experi
 ence of putting his bottom in the air for pretty girls he calls Mommy.  He 
 has written and produced two websites on ageplay and relationships as well 
 as living a "little" lifestyle for well over a decade.  He has watched and 
 blogged as adult babies and Littles crept from the fringe of the kink world
  to the flavor of the week they are today.  In addition to being open about
  his littleness\, William gets paid to talk and teach professionally\, so h
 e feels like this class on his favorite subject should be a piece of cake. 
  Famous last words...

DESCRIPTION:Pretty Please? The Basics of Begging\n\nBegging is one of the f
 inest talents a submissive can possess\, for in begging one can display the
 ir desire\, humility and obeisance to their dominant. This workshop will te
 ach submissives how to articulate their pleas in a most pleasing manner. Do
 minants are\, of course\, welcome in this workshop\, so that they may learn
  how to mold their submissives into expert beggers.\n\nWorkshop fee - TBD\n
 Doors will open at 6:00 p.m. and class will start promptly at 6:30 p.m.\n\n
 This workshop is followed by our regularly scheduled play party\, and is op
 en to all RKS Members and approved guests.\n\nAbout Schadenfreude\n\nSchade
 nfreude is a young\, but experienced dominant sadomasochist with a passion 
 for pain and teaching others about BDSM. When she first discovered BDSM at 
 the age of 18\, she was too young to join the scene\, so she founded her ow
 n educational BDSM organization at her undergraduate university. Once she t
 urned 21\, she officially joined the scene and blossomed into the wicked sa
 domasochist that she is today. To give back to the wonderful community that
  nurtured her kinky skills and knowledge\, she became a Deputy DM\, then a 
 board member of the Rochester Kink Society\, and now a BDSM workshop presen
 ter.\n

DESCRIPTION:RKS welcomes Grant for a workshop on Interrogation.\n\nInterrog
 ations: Power and Persuasion\nThis class covers interrogation scenes and in
 terrogation roleplay.  A good interrogation scene goes well beyond “beat th
 e bottom until they safeword”- this class will cover the essential elements
  of any interrogation\, issues you may wish to consider\, and creative ways
  for you to incorporate this type of play into your “toybag.”  We will disc
 uss how to prepare for a scene\, set the physical and emotional stage\, con
 duct a successful scene and ultimately repair any physical or psychological
  hurt you may have caused.  This class will include an intense demonstratio
 n\, and will include advanced/edgy play that could be uncomfortable for som
 e participants to watch.\n\nBio\nGrant Emerson has been involved in the lif
 estyle for 15 years (and reading about it for 5 years before that) in both 
 dominant and submissive roles. This experience has grown from events in Den
 ver where he started in the scene to the Midwest where he spent many years 
 before moving east to Massachusetts attending events up and down the easter
 n seaboard. Combining his college major in organizational and interpersonal
  communications along with his extensive lifestyle background has given an 
 interest into not only how we relate to each other in relationships\, but a
 lso how we relate to each other as dominants\, submissives and everything i
 n between. Currently he is the Chapter President of Delta Sigma and has pre
 viously held numerous elected positions in major volunteer organizations.\n
 \nPrice TBD\n\nDoors will open at 6 p.m. and class will start promptly at 6
 :30 p.m.  \n\nFollowed by our regularly scheduled play party.\n\nQuestions?

DESCRIPTION:RKS Welcomes Back Jules!\n\nLet's Do This: Negotiating scenes a
 nd relationships in kink\n\nThis class covers why and how to establish and 
 communicate your boundaries for kinky play and relationships. It will inclu
 de methods for negotiating\, specific points you may wish to include in you
 r negotiations\, and ways to make negotiations hot! This class will also he
 lp you use this form of communication to determine when you should or shoul
 d not go ahead with play or a relationship. An essential skill for tops and
  bottoms alike\, negotiating sets the stage for hot play and helps prevent 
 miscommunication.\n\nIf you’re not yet sure of your boundaries\, or are int
 erested in how to negotiate with kinksters whose approaches are very differ
 ent from your own\, this is the class for you! If you’re afraid that outlin
 ing every detail of your play ahead of time will make your scene shrivel up
 \, this class will help you find ways to share information with your partne
 r without ruining elements of control and surprise. \n\nAbout the Presenter
 :  Jules Emerson\nJules is a co-leader of Buffalo TNG and a liaison team me
 mber for the Rochester Kink Society. She’s been active in the public BDSM a
 nd fetish communities in varying degrees since the late 90’s\, and has foun
 d substantial fulfillment in furthering kink education.\n\nJules holds a bl
 ack belt in Judo and also has a background as a university level educator a
 nd researcher in psychology and business.  She takes great joy in morphing 
 her her substantial education fetish with her vanilla expertise to provide 
 classes for kinksters that are based in research\, experience\, and best pr
 actices! Jules teaches classes on stapling\, needle play\, negotiation\, ro
 ugh body play\, breathplay\, and more.\n\nDoors will open at 6 p.m. and the
  workshop will start promptly at 6:30 p.m.\n\nPrice:  $5 members\, $10 gues

DESCRIPTION:Non-traditional Inspiration and Restraints Workshop (Very inter
 active)\n\nDo you find Dexter’s kill room to be scary and erotic? Have you 
 gotten aroused by war crimes depicted in a documentary? This is dark\, pote
 ntially dangerous stuff to “play” with but as a small group we will explore
  these feelings with an emphasis on bringing those fantasies to life in a s
 afe and risk aware manner. We will dissect several examples of realistic\, 
 potentially criminal activities with the purpose of figuring out how to saf
 ely enact a version of those. Many of these examples use restraints less co
 mmonly found in kink which each carry their own risks. The instructor will 
 bring a number of different restraints to class for students to destroy in 
 the safest and fastest manner possible.\n\nDoors will open at 2:00 p.m. and
  the class will start promptly at 2:30 p.m.\n\nPrice TBD\n\nJoin us for our
  evening workshop by the same presenter - Rape Play! Followed by our regula
 rly scheduled play party.\n\nAbout the Presenter:\n\nFrozen Meursault has 6
  years experience in emergency medicine and is a CPR/1st Aid instructor as 
 well as an instructor for advanced medical providers in resuscitation and t
 rauma care. He has no illusions about his knowledge and skills and always s
 trives to expand both. His approach to care and instruction is based on hon
 esty and clarity as well as passion and compassion. Ultimately we are all i
 n this together and you may end up saving his life one day.\n\nAs an instru
 ctor/presenter Frozen Meursault strives to use different methods to make cl
 asses enjoyable\, interactive\, memorable and beneficial to all different l
 earning styles. The kink itself should be the painful stuff\, not learning 
 about it!\n\nHe makes no claims about being a kink expert and his classes a
 re heavily based on his knowledge and experience as a medical provider. As 
 a practitioner of kink he views himself as a sadist who enjoys impact\, con
 /non-con\, rough body play\, rope\, and making pretty people cry.

DESCRIPTION:Through force or coercion and independent of gender\, rape play
  can be terrifying and erotic for both the top and bottom.  Taking a “how-t
 o” approach this class provides a number of actionable points for students 
 to begin using as they explore rape play. Safety will be addressed with an 
 emphasis placed on recognizing risks and mitigating them to give students a
  foundation to build upon. By focusing more on practical points than lofty 
 discussions this class is an effective jumping off point for play.\n\nCost 
 - TBD\n\nPlease arrive to this class on time!\n\nRegularly Scheduled Play P
 arty to Follow.\n\nAbout the Presenter:\n\nFrozen Meursault has 6 years exp
 erience in emergency medicine and is a CPR/1st Aid instructor as well as an
  instructor for advanced medical providers in resuscitation and trauma care
 . He has no illusions about his knowledge and skills and always strives to 
 expand both. His approach to care and instruction is based on honesty and c
 larity as well as passion and compassion. Ultimately we are all in this tog
 ether and you may end up saving his life one day.\n\nAs an instructor/prese
 nter Frozen Meursault strives to use different methods to make classes enjo
 yable\, interactive\, memorable and beneficial to all different learning st
 yles. The kink itself should be the painful stuff\, not learning about it!\
 n\nHe makes no claims about being a kink expert and his classes are heavily
  based on his knowledge and experience as a medical provider. As a practiti
 oner of kink he views himself as a sadist who enjoys impact\, con/non-con\,
  rough body play\, rope\, and making pretty people cry.

DESCRIPTION:What's more terrifying than facing one sadistic Top? Facing two
 ! This class with demo will teach you the many styles of co-topping from co
 operative to competitive. Learn to combine your forces of sadism with a fel
 low dominant to give your submissive the thrill of their life. For best res
 ults in this class\, bring your favorite flogger or riding crop so that you
  can participate in the demo!\n\nCost:  $5 RKS Members\; $10 guests.  Regul
 arly scheduled play party to follow.\n\nBio:\n\nSchadenfreude is a young\, 
 but experienced dominant sadomasochist with a passion for pain and teaching
  others about BDSM. When she first discovered BDSM at the age of 18\, she w
 as too young to join the scene\, so she founded her own educational BDSM or
 ganization at her undergraduate university. Once she turned 21\, she offici
 ally joined the scene and blossomed into the wicked sadomasochist that she 
 is today. To give back to the wonderful community that nurtured her kinky s
 kills and knowledge\, she became a Deputy DM\, then a board member of the R
 ochester Kink Society\, and now a BDSM workshop presenter.

DESCRIPTION:On the edge: A hands-on breathplay workshop\n\nBreathplay can b
 e intimate\, terrifying\, hazy\, trust-building\, calming\, or induce a sta
 te of panic. By its nature\, breathplay requires close physical contact and
  invasion of personal space (and interruption of basic life functions).\n\n
 Are you curious about breathplay? Does the thought of a bottom gasping for 
 air leave you swooning? This class will cover the restriction of bloodflow 
 and airflow to a willing (or struggling) bottom through a variety of means.
  Breathplay takes players to the edge of life by controlling another’s abil
 ity to survive- it can be used to enhance power exchange dynamics\, to rele
 ase endorphins\, or to piss off Jay Wiseman. We will discuss the risks inhe
 rent to breathplay\, how to best judge the acceptability of those risks for
  your own situation\, and ways to mitigate some of the dangers of breathpla
 y. You will leave this class having explored some of the various forms of b
 reathplay\, and have a better idea of what works for you. If you don’t have
  a partner\, you can pair up with someone willing during the class- but sin
 ce trust is critical\, this class will be structured so that those who aren
 ’t comfortable participating can also learn by watching others.\n\nDue to t
 he importance of the safety information for this course\, we ask that you p
 lease arrive on time. (Doors will open at 6 p.m. the class will start PROMP
 TLY at 6:30 - note - NOT RKS time\, REAL time!)\n\nCost of workshop:  TBD\n
 \nPlease join us immediately following for our regularly scheduled play par
 ty (regular guest fees apply)\n\nAbout Jules:\nJules is a co-leader of Buff
 alo TNG and a liaison team member for the Rochester Kink Society. She's bee
 n active in the public BDSM and fetish communities in varying degrees since
  the late 90's\, and has found substantial fulfillment in furthering kink e
 ducation. One of her passions in kink is exhibiting brutality through force
  and control\, and she has been strangling opponents in the dojo for decade
 s. Jules holds a black belt in Judo\, and since beginning her Judo career a
 t age 4\, she has served as a coach\, referee\, and national level competit
 or. She also dabbles occasionally in Brazilian and Japanese Jiu Jitsu\, and

 the application of force.

 ou high-fives.\n \nExcept this isn't the reality of the situation. Not only
  did you screw up during the scene\, you didn't even know you screwed up. Y
 our bottom not only isn't going to ever play with you again\, they are goin

DESCRIPTION:Floorties: Dynamic Ebb and Flow\n \nFloor ties do not have to b
 e static. Even if the bottom is not moving on the ground\, their experience
  of the tie does not have to be a plateau. Instead it can be a progression 
 or hill. During this class\, we will explore ratcheting up the intensity of
  our floor ties.\n During this hands on class\, we will start with a basic 
 floor tie\, such as a Gyaku-Ebi (hogtie)\, and experiment with adding addit
 ional ropes to make the tie progressively more stringent. There will be a f
 ocus on how to make the tie tougher on the bottom while still making sure i
 t is as safe as possible. This class will also show how to use asymmetry on
  the ground to psychologically make your tie tougher on your bottom.\n \nTh
 is class is appropriate for intermediate level students. You should have a 
 working knowledge of one and two column ties and a chest harness (preferabl
 y an arms bound harness). Please bring 6 lengths of rope 25-30 feet long.\n
  \nPLEASE NOTE - Class will start promptly at 5:00p\, doors will be open by
  4:45p - please arrive on time!\n \nThis is a whole day of rope!\n \nJoin u

DESCRIPTION:Single Rope Ties\n \nRope can be expensive (especially for natu
 ral fibers) or time consuming to condition by hand. Carrying a full kit of 
 rope with you to a party/event can be heavy or awkward. This class will gui
 de students through steps to simplify and make their rope work more minimal
 istic. In this class\, students will be shown methods for determining the s
 tructural elements of various common Japanese style ties in order to break 
 those ties down to their basic elements and create a simpler version using 
 only one rope. Please bring one (and only one) rope 25-30 feet long.\n \nPL

DESCRIPTION:This class is a hands-on approach to rough body play. Did you k
 now that your body is a weapon? Incredibly intimate play can arise when you
  throw away the toys and get personal with your partner. Learn how to use y
 our own body to create experiences that range from intense and demanding to
  breathtakingly knee-weakening. This class will cover physical control\, pu
 nching\, kicking\, manhandling\, dragging\, basic grappling\, and learning 
 to use your partner as a rag-doll.\n\nTops: Come learn some new skills and 
 how to use them in a safer way! Learn how to set up your environment\, how 
 to adapt your situational awareness to the unique demands of Rough Body Pla
 y\, and how to protect your bottom from harm while having your way with the
 m.\n\nBottoms: For each area we cover\, we'll practice how to protect yours
 elf from non-consensual injury during these activities. Rough Body Play req
 uires some knowledge and training from bottoms\, so come get yours!\n\nThis
  is a hands-on workshop- please come prepared for a workout! Athletic appar
 el/comfy clothing recommended. No prior experience or fitness level is need
 ed- rough body play is adaptable to all body types and fitness levels!\n\nA
 bout Jules:\nJules is a co-leader of Buffalo TNG and a liaison team member 
 for the Rochester Kink Society. She's been active in the public BDSM and fe
 tish communities in varying degrees since the late 90's\, and has found sub
 stantial fulfillment in furthering kink education. One of her passions in k
 ink is exhibiting brutality through force and control\, and she can often b
 e found roundhousing a helpless\, restrained bottom while wearing platform 
 heels. Jules holds a black belt in Judo\, and since beginning her Judo care
 er at age 4\, she has served as a coach\, referee\, and national level comp
 etitor. She also dabbles occasionally in Brazilian and Japanese Jiu Jitsu\,
  and has a special fondness for restricting others' ability to breathe thro
 ugh the application of force.\n\nJoin us for our regularly scheduled play p

DESCRIPTION:Presented by RKS Member Talos.\n\n$5 for members\, $10 for gues
 ts. \n\nPlay Party to Follow.\n\nDoors will open at 6 p.m. and the class wi
 ll start at 6:30 p.m.\n\nMy name is Talos and I’ve been in and around BDsM 
 and kink since the late 80’s. I’ve spent the past several years living a 24
 /7 Master/slave relationship\, as well as\, being a leader in the local kin
 k community. Over the course of over two decades of learning and growth I’v
 e developed a wide array of technique’s and knowledge that I’ve gladly taug
 ht to others.  I have taken the basic techniques and searched for new and d
 ifferent ways to apply them.  In doing so I have found that others have als
 o adopted them into their repertoire. I’ve given various classes involving 
 caning\, flogging\, BDsM 101\, safety\, and etiquette.\n\nI’ve always belie
 ved the devil is in the details. To do anything properly\, you should learn
  the craft. Anybody can put paint on a canvas\, but in the hands of a craft
 sman a work of art can created. Months and years can be spent to learn the 
 best touch. Now this isn’t practical or feasible for every application\, bu
 t it can be a useful gauge towards learning. I believe that taking the time
  to learn the basics will give a solid foundation for advanced techniques a
 nd independent learning.\n\nThe caning workshop concentrates on the oldest 
 of all toys\, the stick. The material will cover: types/materials of canes\
 , where to hit\, how to hit\, general safety\, styles of play\, and include
  hands on practice. For people who have taken my class in the past you’ve l
 earned the technique called the Rattan Rabbit. Because there have been so m
 any requests I will make sure to teach that\, ladies you will thank me late
 r.\n\nParticipants will need to bring their own canes. \n\nPlease note that
  canes should have a degree of flex to them. Something too rigid (like a do
 wel or broom handle) won’t flex and provide the same sort of impact. Yes\, 
 we will even cover how different things hit differently. Below is a list of
  some places I’ve used to get canes from or heard good things about.  \n\nw

DESCRIPTION:What the hell was that?!? A common question when the fire flogg
 ers come out to play. What is fire flogging? It is quite simply the most fl
 ashy thing allowed in most dungeons....and frequently not allowed. It is ta
 king specially made floggers\, dunking them unto a fuel mixture\, lighting 
 them on fire and using them like a regular flogger....I can assure you ther

 o Sadist has been in the scene for over a decade. He has been with his coll
 ared slave dottie (slutress) since he entered the scene. His leather family
  consists of himself\, his alpha slave dottie and their femsubs caroline & 
 sammi\, his boy rain\, Monika\, Horns\, Tia\, Amylynne & JD...along with so
 me nieces & nephews along the way. Together with dottie Brian founded The G
 ate one of the of largest munch groups in the Philadelphia area which is st
 ill going strong and then started a second chapter of The Gate in Massachus
 etts. The two of them own Needle Play Design\, their custom embroidering co
 mpany. Brian is fairly well known as being a "bit off" and fascinated by fi
 re As a child there were several fires of unexplained origin in his neighbo
 rhood that had nothing in common....except that Brian seemed to be always n
 earby with a bag of marshmallows and several books of matches.\n\nTo this d
 ay whenever there is a bonfire nearby onlookers say they frequently hear Br
 ian cackling "Fire fire!" Apparently it is now known where that particular 
 sound snippet from Bevis & Butthead came from. The men in the white coats h
 ave orders to keep him under surveillance and the gas stations near his hou

DESCRIPTION:What is fire cupping? It’s actually an ancient oriental healing
  method that some have perverted for fun (I know\, you're shocked!) The sen
 sations can vary depending on the person and the placement of the cups. I w
 ill go over and demonstrate most of the techniques of cupping as well as pl
 acement of the cups. A warning to those who want to try the cups\; I can AL
 MOST promise you that you will have marks that will last between several ho
 urs to several days (and in some cases\, several weeks).\n\nThis is a whole
  day of fire!\n\nJoin us after this class for two more classes and a play p
 arty!\nBefore this class we will have [Dance With Flames]https://fetlife.co
 m/events/148887] and then Fire Flogging will run from 7-8 with our play par
 ty immediately following and rocking until 2 a.m.!\n\nPrices!\n\nThree Grea
 t Workshops plus one rocking Play Party!\n\nOne Workshop - $10 for members\
 , $15 for guests\nTwo Workshops - $15 for members\, $25 for guests\nAll thr
 ee workshops - $20 for members\, $30 for guests\n\nSpecial Guest Fee for th
 e Play party - $20 (regular fees for members\, where applicable)\n\nThis\, 
 and all RKS workshops\, are open to RKS members and approved guests only. P
 lease email rks@rochesterkinksociety.com with any questions.\n\nAbout Pyro 
 Sadist:\n\nBrian AKA Pyro Sadist has been in the scene for over a decade. H
 e has been with his collared slave dottie (slutress) since he entered the s
 cene. His leather family consists of himself\, his alpha slave dottie and t
 heir femsubs caroline & sammi\, his boy rain\, Monika\, Horns\, Tia\, Amyly
 nne & JD...along with some nieces & nephews along the way. Together with do
 ttie Brian founded The Gate one of the of largest munch groups in the Phila
 delphia area which is still going strong and then started a second chapter 
 of The Gate in Massachusetts. The two of them own Needle Play Design\, thei
 r custom embroidering company. Brian is fairly well known as being a "bit o
 ff" and fascinated by fire As a child there were several fires of unexplain
 ed origin in his neighborhood that had nothing in common....except that Bri
 an seemed to be always nearby with a bag of marshmallows and several books 
 of matches.\n\nTo this day whenever there is a bonfire nearby onlookers say
  they frequently hear Brian cackling "Fire fire!" Apparently it is now know
 n where that particular sound snippet from Bevis & Butthead came from. The 
 men in the white coats have orders to keep him under surveillance and the g
 as stations near his house no longer fill up his gas cans.

DESCRIPTION:RKS welcomes Pyro_Sadist for a day of Fire at the RKS Dungeon!\
 n\nFireplay is definitely edge play\, for anything with fire is implicitly 
 dangerous. But I have found that fireplay has a sensual eroticism and art t
 o it that so many can relate to. Who among us hasn't sat transfixed gazing 
 into a fires light. And to feel and witness that same sensual flow of warm 
 flame across our bodies\, lapping over\, then passing and leaving only a wa
 rm lingering touch. No experience is necessary for this class\, some practi
 ce materials will be available for use. Both technique\, safety\, and sensu
 al/art/erotic applications will be gone over in this class. Even if you mig
 ht not think it's quite your thing\, you might be surprised by the sensual 
 beauty and artistry of the flame.\n\nThis is a whole day of fire!\n\nJoin u
 s after this class for two more classes and a play party!\nSuck You - an In
 tro to Cupping will be held from 5-6:30 then Fire Flogging will run from 7-
 8 with our play party immediately following and rocking until 2 a.m.!\n\nPr

 s class will teach the participant some basic techniques for suturing and s
 ome ways to use suturing relatively safely in a BDSM scene. This class does
